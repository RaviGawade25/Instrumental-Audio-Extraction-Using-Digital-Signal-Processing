Description

This project implements a DSP-based approach to suppress vocal components from stereo audio signals and extract instrumental background music using MATLAB.

Methodology

Stereo Mid–Side signal decomposition

Vocal band identification (300–3400 Hz)

Butterworth band-stop filtering

Time-domain and frequency-domain validation

Tools & Technologies

MATLAB

FFT

Digital Filters (Butterworth)

Results

Clear attenuation of vocal frequency band in output spectrum

Instrumental components preserved with minimal distortion

Applications

Audio preprocessing for embedded DSP systems

Signal conditioning for real-time audio applications
